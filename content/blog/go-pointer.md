## Pointer

A pointer holds the memory address of a value

| Operator  | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| &variable | Give me the **memory address** of the value this variable is pointing at |
| *pointer  | Give me the **value** this memory address is referring to |

```go
func main () {
  i := 11
  p := &i
  fmt.Println(*p) // 11, read i through the pointer
}
func main() {
  i, j := 42, 27
  p := &i         // point to i
  fmt.Println(p)  // 0x40e020
  fmt.Println(*p) // 42, read i through the pointer

  *p = 21         // set i through the pointer
  fmt.Println(i)  // 21

  p = &j
  *p = *p / 3    // divide j through the pointer
  fmt.Println(j) // 9
}
```

## Method (Receiver function)

Go does not have classes. However, you can define method, which is a receiver function, on custom types.

```go
type deck []string

func (d deck) print() {
  for _, deck := range d {
    fmt.Println(deck)
  }
}

func main() {
  d := newDeck()
  d.print()
}
```

You can also declare a method on non-struct types. You can only declare a method with a receiver whose type is defined in the same package as the method.

```go
type MyFloat float64

func (f MyFloat) Abs() float64 {
  if f < 0 {
    return float64(-f)
  }
  return float64(f)
}

func main() {
  f := MyFloat(-math.Sqrt(10))
  fmt.Println(f.Abs())
}
```

## Pointer receivers

Go is a **pass by value** language. Whenever we pass value into a function, go will take that value(or struct), copy all the data and *place* it inside a new memory, which is what we know as **immutable**. So it means we are not able to update the struct passed into the method.

| Types           | Description |
| --------------- | ----------- |
| Value types     | int, float, string, bool, *structs* |
| Reference types | slices, maps, channels, pointers, functions |

```go
type person struct{
  name string
  age  int
}
func (p person) updateName(n string) {
  // because p here is a copy of kevin, not kevin itself!
  p.bane = n
}

func main() {
  kevin := person{
    name: "kevin",
    age:  32,
  }
  kevin.updateName("kephin")
  kevin.print() // not changed -> {name:kevin age:32}
}
```

:bulb: How does Go do

Declare receiver function with pointer receiver

> Here `*type` is the type description, it means the it's the pointer. It's not the operator as we saw `*pointer`

```go
// *person is the type description, it means p is the pointer type
func (p *person) updateName(n string) {
  // *p here, however means the value the pointer is referring to
  (*p).name = n
  // or we can simply just do
  p.name = n
}
func main() {
  kevin := person{
    name: "kevin",
    age:  32,
  }
  (&kevin).updateName("kephin")
  kevin.print() // changed -> {name:kephin age:32}
}
```

### Receiver functions and regular functions

Receiver functions are just like functions. However, the difference is that functions with a pointer argument *must* take a pointer:

```go
type Vertex struct {
  X, Y float64
}
func ScaleFunc(v *Vertex, f float64) {
  // ...
}
var v Vertex
ScaleFunc(v, 5)  // Compile error!
ScaleFunc(&v, 5) // OK
```

while methods with pointer receivers take *either a value or a pointer* as the receiver when they are called:

```go
func (v *Vertex) Scale(f float64) {
  // ...
}
var v Vertex
v.Scale(5)  // OK, Go interprets the statement v.Scale(5) as (&v).Scale(5)
p := &v
p.Scale(10) // OK
```

Th9s happens in the reverse direction.

Functions that take a value argument must take a value of that specific type while methods with value receivers take either a value or a pointer as the receiver when they are called:

```go
func (v Vertex) Abs() float64 {
  // ...
}
func AbsFunc(v Vertex) float64 {
  // ...
}
v := Vertex{3, 4}
v.Abs()      // OK
(&v).Abs()   // OK
AbsFunc(v)   // OK
AbsFunc(&v)  // Compile error!
```

There are two reasons to use a pointer receiver.

1. ï¼­ethod can modify the value that its receiver points to
2. To avoid copying the value on each method call. This can be more efficient if the receiver is a large struct
