## Basic Concept of React Native

### What is React Native

React Native is like ReactDOM. It is a library that allows you to render React components to native mobile UI elements in iOS or Android device.

### What React Native does

ðŸ‘‰ Rect Components will be compiled

We will write React components and React Native will compile and bundle them to Real Native App code to respective platform equivalents.

| Web Browser | Android   | iOs         | React Native JSX |
| ----------- | --------- | ----------- | ---------------- |
| `<div>`     | ViewGroup | UIView      | `<View>`         |
| `<input>`   | EditText  | UITextField | `<TextInput>`    |
| `<p>`       | TextView  | UITextView  | `<Text>`         |

ðŸ‘‰ Logic will not be compiled

React Native will spin up a JavaScript process as part of the native app and it allows this process to talk to the underlying Android or iOS platform.

### Expo CLI & React Native CLI

Expo

- Third-party library
- Provides a lot of features out of the box
- Easy to get started with
- Provides `managed workflow` and `bare workflow`
- Can eject to bare workflow at any time

REACT NATIVE CLI

- By React-Native team
- Bare-bone setup
- Easier integration with native code

### Getting Started

ðŸ‘‰ Running React Native app on your phone

1. Install Expo CLI

   ```bash
   npm install -g expo-cli
   expo init my-project
   ```

2. Download `Expo Go` app on your phone
3. Run `npm start` to start the development server
4. Scan the QR code with `Expo Go` app
5. Make changes to the code and save and the app will automatically reload

ðŸ‘‰ Running React Native app on your simulator

1. Download Android Studio for Android or Xcode for iOS

   - Open Android Studio and open Virtual Device Manager, create a new device that is available for Play Store with the latest version of Android. Then, launch the emulator.
   - Open Simulator from Xcode and create a new simulator of latest iPhone

2. Go to the terminal, Press `i` for iOS simulator or `a` for Android simulator
3. We can run both iOS and Android simulator at the same time
4. Make changes to the code and save and the app will automatically reload

## React Native Basics

Expo will take `App.js` as the entry point of the app.

### Core UI Components

`<View>` is to hold and layout other components.

- You cannot put text strings directly into the `<View>`.
- By default, every `<View>` uses `flexbox` and is set `flexDirection: "column"`.

`<ScrollView>` is to scroll the content.

- `<ScrollView>` is for making a scrollable container but not able to set the height of the container. so if you want to set the height of the container, you need to wrap the `<ScrollView>` inside a `<View>` and set the height of the `<View>`.
- `<ScrollView>` will render all the list items at once, so it is not recommended to use `<ScrollView>` for a long list of items, which will cause performance issues.

`<FlatList>` will only render the visible items, and all the items that are outside of the screen will be loaded on demand (or rendered lazily).

- `<FlatList>` requires a `data` prop to render the list of items.
- `<FlatList>` requires a `renderItem` prop as function to tell `<FlatList>` how to render each item.
- two ways to provide a key to each item:
  - `key` field in the data item object
  - we can take from any field, for example: id. then add `keyExtractor` prop as function to return the key for each item.

```js
<FlatList
  data={courseGoals}
  renderItem={itemData => {
    return (
      <View style={styles.goalItem}>
        <Text style={styles.goalText}>{itemData.item.text}</Text>
      </View>
    );
  }}
  keyExtractor={(item, index) => {
    return item.id;
  }}
/>
```

`<Text>` is for displaying text.

- Text supports nesting styling, and touch handling.
- Can't have a text node as child of a `<View>`.

The `<Text>` element is unique relative to layout: everything inside is no longer using the Flexbox layout but using text layout. This means that elements inside of a `<Text>` are no longer rectangles, but wrap when they see the end of the line.

```jsx
<Text>
  <Text>First part and </Text>
  <Text>second part</Text>
</Text>
// Text container: the text will be inline if the space allowed it
// |First part and second part|

// otherwise, the text will flow as if it was one
// |First part |
// |and second |
// |part       |

<View>
  <Text>First part and </Text>
  <Text>second part</Text>
</View>
// View container: each text is its own block
// |First part and|
// |second part   |

// otherwise, the text will flow in its own block
// |First part |
// |and        |
// |second part|
```

`<Image>`

- requires `source` prop to display an image. And we can use `require()` to load the image from the local file system by relative path.

```js
<Image source={require("../assets/images/goal.png")} />
```

`<LinearGradient>`

- If we want transitions of multiple colors in a linear direction, we can install `expo install expo-linear-gradient` and provide an array of colors as prop it.

```js
import { LinearGradient } from "expo-linear-gradient";

<LinearGradient
  colors={["#4c669f", "#3b5998", "#192f6a"]}
  style={styles.button}
>
  <Text>Sign in with Facebook</Text>
</LinearGradient>;
```

`<ImageBackground>`

- source: the image to display
- resizeMode: how to resize the image when the frame doesn't match the raw image dimensions
- style: styles to apply to the `<View>` wrapping the `<Image>`
- imageStyle: styles to apply to the `<Image>`

```js
import { ImageBackground } from "react-native";

<ImageBackground
  source={require("../assets/images/background.jpg")}
  resizeMode="cover"
  style={styles.image}
  imageStyle={{ opacity: 0.5 }}
/>;
```

`<SafeAreaView>`

- This is to render content within the safe area boundaries of a device (under the notch on iPhone X and above).

```js
import { Text, SafeAreaView } from "react-native";

const App = () => (
  <SafeAreaView style={styles.container}>
    <Text style={styles.text}>Page content</Text>
  </SafeAreaView>
);
```

### Styling & Layout

We can style the components in 2 ways:

- Inline style
- StyleSheet object: by using `StyleSheet.create()`, we get the benefit of auto-completion, validation and performance improvement.

We can also pass an array of styles - the last style in the array has precedence, so you can use this to inherit styles. This is useful to create a flexible custom components.

```js
import { StyleSheet, Text, View, Button } from "react-native";

export const Card = ({ children, style }) => {
  return <View style={[styles.card, style]}>{children}</View>;
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  card: {
    justifyContent: "center",
    alignItems: "center",
    marginTop: 36,
    marginHorizontal: 24,
  },
});
```

- Layouts are typically created using the `flexbox` system.
- Unlike web css, the styles don't cascade/inherit. So if you want to apply the same style to multiple components, you need to create a style object and pass it to each component.
- We can add styles inside `app.json` to apply the same style to all the components.

```json
{
  "expo": {
    // ...
    "backgroundColor": "#1e085a"
  }
}
```

- If we want to add shadow,
  - for android, we can use `elevation` prop, the higher the number, the higher the shadow
  - for iOS, we can use `shadowColor`, `shadowOffset`, `shadowOpacity`, `shadowRadius` props

```js
const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  inputContainer: {
    elevation: 4,
    shadowColor: "black",
    shadowOffset: { width: 0, height: 2 },
    shadowRadius: 6,
    shadowOpacity: 0.25,
  },
});
```

### Interactivity & State

`<TextInput>` is for user input

- onChangeText: listen to the change
- value: use `value` prop to set the value
- maxLength: set a number for max length
- keyboardType: `<TextInput />` allows you to control which keyboard is opened by the device. For example, you can use `keyboardType="number-pad"` to open a numeric keyboard.
- autoCapitalize: we can disables auto-capitalize for email input
- autoCorrect: we can disables auto-correct for email input

```js
<TextInput
  style={styles.textInput}
  placeholder="Your course goal!"
  onChangeText={goalInputHandler}
  value={value}
  maxLength={10}
  keybroadType="numeric"
  autoCapitalize="none"
  autoCorrect={false}
/>
```

`<Button>`

- use `onPress` prop in `<Button>` to listen to the click event.
- `<Button>` does not support `style` prop, but it supports `color` prop.

```js
<Button title="Add Goal" onPress={addGoalHandler} />
```

`<Pressable>` is a Core Component wrapper that can detect various stages of press interactions on any of its defined children.

- use `onPressIn` prop in `<Pressable>` to listen to the press in event.
- onPress style change:
  - for android, we can use `android_ripple` prop to add ripple effect on press.
  - for iOS, we can use the `style` prop as a function, which receive the object has `pressed` property, so we can check if `pressed` is `true` to add the pressed style, often it will be `opacity: 0.X`.
- since we cannot do much customization on `<Button>`, if we do want to style our own button, you have to build with the `<Pressable>` component.

#### How to create custom buttons?

There's a common problem when building a custom button on Android: the ripple effect is outside of the button. -> We should move `<Pressable>` inside of `<View>`. Then we'll have,

- one outer container will be `<View />` holds the `<Pressable>`, we should have `borderRadius` and `overflow: "hidden"` in the style, which makes sure the ripple effect is inside of the button.
- one inner container will be `<Pressable>` holds `<Text>`

```js
const CustomButton = ({ title, children }) => {
  const handleOnPress = () => {};

  return (
    <View style={styles.buttonOuterContainer}>
      <Pressable
        onPress={handleOnPress}
        android_ripple={{ color: "#640233" }}
        style={({ pressed }) => [
          styles.buttonInnerContainer,
          pressed ? styles.pressed : null,
        ]}
      >
        <Text style={styles.buttonText}>{title}</Text>
      </Pressable>
    </View>
  );
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  buttonOuterContainer: {
    borderRadius: 28,
    margin: 4,
    overflow: "hidden",
  },
  buttonInnerContainer: {
    backgroundColor: "#72063c",
    paddingVertical: 8,
    paddingHorizontal: 16,
    elevation: 2,
  },
  buttonText: {
    color: "white",
    textAlign: "center",
  },
  pressed: {
    opacity: 0.75,
  },
});
```

`<Modal>`

- use `visible` prop to show or hide the modal.
- use `animationType` prop to set the animation type, 'none', 'slide or 'fade', of the modal.
- use `onRequestClose` prop to listen to the close event.

`<StatusBar>` is to control the app's status bar.

- use `style` prop to set the style of the status bar, 'auto', 'inverted', 'light' or 'dark'.

```js
import { StatusBar } from "expo-status-bar";

<StatusBar style="light" />;
```

`<Alert>` Launches an alert dialog with the specified title and message.

- use `Alert.alert()` to show the alert.

```ts
static Alert (
  title: string,
  message?: string,
  buttons?: AlertButton[],
);

type AlertButton = {
  text: string;
  onPress: () => void;
  style?: 'default' | 'cancel' | 'destructive'; // ios
};
```

```js
import { Alert } from "react-native";

Alert.alert("Invalid number!", "Number has to be a number between 1 and 99.", [
  { text: "Okay", style: "destructive", onPress: resetInputHandler },
]);
```

### Icons & Fonts

@expo/vector-icons is a expo embedded library that allows you to use icons from the popular icon libraries like Material Icons, Ionicons, Font Awesome, and Zocial.

```js
import Ionicons from "@expo/vector-icons/Ionicons";

export default function App() {
  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Ionicons name="md-checkmark-circle" size={32} color="green" />
    </View>
  );
}
```

### Splash Screen & Loading Fonts

Splash Screen is the very first screen the users see when they open up an app on a mobile device. It's also been called launch screen. This is useful to do tasks that will happen behind the scenes such as making API calls, pre-loading fonts.

```js
import * as SplashScreen from "expo-splash-screen";
import * as Font from "expo-font";

// Keep the splash screen visible while we fetch resources
SplashScreen.preventAutoHideAsync();

export default function App() {
  const [appIsReady, setAppIsReady] = useState(false);

  useEffect(() => {
    async function prepare() {
      try {
        // Pre-load fonts, make any API calls you need to do here
        await Font.loadAsync(Entypo.font);
      } catch (e) {
        console.warn(e);
      } finally {
        // Tell the application to render
        setAppIsReady(true);
      }
    }

    prepare();
  }, []);

  const onLayoutRootView = useCallback(async () => {
    if (appIsReady) {
      // This tells the splash screen to hide immediately! If we call this after
      // `setAppIsReady`, then we may see a blank screen while the app is
      // loading its initial state and rendering its first pixels. So instead,
      // we hide the splash screen once we know the root view has already
      // performed layout.
      await SplashScreen.hideAsync();
    }
  }, [appIsReady]);

  if (!appIsReady) {
    return null;
  }

  return (
    <View
      style={{ flex: 1, alignItems: "center", justifyContent: "center" }}
      onLayout={onLayoutRootView}
    >
      <Text>Hello world!</Text>
    </View>
  );
}
```

### Building Adaptive & Responsive UIs

- Adjust to different screen sizes with `Dimensions` API
- Adjust to different screen orientations with `Dimensions` API
- Execute platform-specific code with `Platform.OS` and `Platform.select()`

#### Setting Dynamic width

Set width and MaxWidth and the same time, so that it will try to take `width` until it reaches `maxWidth`.

```js
const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    maxWidth: "80%",
    width: 300,
  },
});
```

#### Introduce `Dimensions` API

We can use `Dimensions` API to get the device width and height. And we can use it as the breakpoint to adjust the UI.

```js
import { Dimensions } from "react-native";

const deviceWidth = Dimensions.get("window").width;
const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    marginTop: deviceWidth > 350 ? 34 : 26,
  },
});
```

## Debugging React Native Errors

### Chrome Inspector

we can choose 'Debug JS Remotely' from the developer menu(by command + D in iOS).

Then we can open the Chrome browser and go to `http://localhost:19000/debugger-ui/` to open the inspector. We can see the console, network tabs.

### React Dev Tools

You can use the standalone version of React Developer Tools to debug the React component hierarchy.

```bash
# install the react-devtools package globally
npm install -g react-devtools

# launch the standalone DevTools app:
react-devtools
```

It should connect to your simulator within a few seconds.

### Debugging application state

**Reactotron** allows you to inspect central store like Redux or MobX-State-Tree application state

### React Native Debugger

This is a standalone app for debugging React Native apps:

- Based on official Remote Debugger and provide more functionality.
- Includes React Inspector
- Includes Redux DevTools
- Includes Apollo Client DevTools

```bach
brew install --cask react-native-debugger
```

To enable network inspect tab, we can config `defaultNetworkInspect` option to true in the config file(in `~/.rndebuggerrc`).
