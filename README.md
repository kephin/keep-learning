# Keep Learning

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/fae01db3-c0d4-4cca-a360-1674a86d26a6/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/keep-learning/deploys)

Blog inspired by [overreacted.io](https://overreacted.io) and forked from [gatsby-starter-blog](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog). I used styled-components instead and changed the style a bit. Also added CI to deploy on netlify thanks to this [blog](https://medium.com/@thundermiracle/deploy-static-sites-to-netlify-by-circle-ci-ab51a0b59b73).

Mostly will write some programming notes from online courses/other blogs/books. From Front-end to Back-end, and DevOps also. Basically it will depends on what I need for work and what I am interested in. And this is my 2020 new year resolution. Hope that I will keep learning :grinning:
