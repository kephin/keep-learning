# Keep Learning

Blog inspired by [overreacted.io](https://overreacted.io) and forked from [gatsby-starter-blog](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog).

This repo/site is for tech notes from online courses/blogs/books. Articles are from Front-end to Back-end, and DevOps also. This was my 2020 new year resolution. Hope that I will keep learning. :muscle::grinning:
