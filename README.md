# Keep Learning

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/fae01db3-c0d4-4cca-a360-1674a86d26a6/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/keep-learning/deploys)

Blog inspired by [overreacted.io](https://overreacted.io) and forked from [gatsby-starter-blog](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog).

This repo/site is for tech notes from online courses/blogs/books. From Front-end to Back-end, and DevOps also. And this was my 2020 new year resolution. Hope that I will keep learning :grinning:
