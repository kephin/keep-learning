# Keep Learning

Blog inspired by [overreacted.io](https://overreacted.io) and forked from [gatsby-starter-blog](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog). Took how [overreacted.io](https://overreacted.io) set up css for code block but changed a little bit of color.

Mostly will write some programming notes from online courses/other blogs/books. From Front-end to Back-end, and DevOps also. Basically it will depends on what I need for work and what I am interested in. And this is my 2020 new year resolution. Hope that I will keep learning :grinning:
